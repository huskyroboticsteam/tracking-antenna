/**
   This is the required "main" file for Catch2. Nothing needs to be in this file except for the
   two preprocessor directives above. The preprocessor will fill in a main function and all the
   stuff Catch2 needs at compile time.
   Tests should instead go in the test/ subdirectory and be added to the CMakeLists.txt.
